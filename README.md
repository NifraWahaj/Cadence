# Cadence
Cadence is a music recommender that uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), content-based filtering and custom similarity algorithms to suggest 20 songs similar to a user-provided song. The recommendations are drawn exclusively from the dataset, with comparisons based on various audio and song features within that dataset.

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   `python app.py`
2. Follow the prompts to input the name of a song and its artist.
3. The system will provide 20 recommendations based on the input song using a combination of content-based filtering and KNN algorithms.
